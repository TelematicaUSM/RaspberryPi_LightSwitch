# RaspberryPi_LightSwitch
This project is meant to be the first step in home automation. To replicate this project you will need a raspberry pi, a 3v relay module, and a 3 way switch. The idea is to be able to turn on and off any light at home from the raspberry py keeping the option to turn it on and off from the switch.
